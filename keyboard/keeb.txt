NOTES for keyboard stuff

copy keyboard handling from usbkeyboard.c/h and convert to c++, double check with doc
 - should be good for handling initial communication and getting hex values
copy key handling, but make bigger case switch for 1234, qwer, asdf, zxcv keys to represent chip8 buttons
fit all this into functions requested by daniel
double check syntax matches c++
test with board using smth like fbputchar.c or have it beep(?)
